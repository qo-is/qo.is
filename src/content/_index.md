**qo.is** is a non-profit association providing hosting services and infrastructure. Our goals are:

🧰 Hosting digital services and infrastructure for our members (individuals, families, other non-profits).  
📜 Publishing of documentation and code to support the wider community to run similar services in a decentralized manner.

💡 We adhere to [Hacker Ethics](https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethik). In short:
  - Access to computers should be unlimited and total.
  - All information should be free.
  - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.
  - Hackers should be judged by their acting, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
  - You can create art and beauty on a computer.
  - Computers can change your life for the better.
  - Don't litter other people's data.
  - Make public data available, protect private data.


🚂 We're a group of self-hosting and nix enthusiasts.
